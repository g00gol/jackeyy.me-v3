# EDHTop16: Revolutionizing MTG Tournament Tracking

EDHTop16 is a comprehensive tournament tracking platform designed specifically for Magic: The Gathering's Commander (EDH) format. What started as a passion project quickly grew into one of the most popular MTG tournament trackers, serving over **100,000+ monthly visitors** and tracking thousands of tournaments worldwide.

## The Problem

The Commander format had a significant gap in tournament data collection and analysis. While other formats had robust tracking systems, Commander players and tournament organizers struggled with:

- **Fragmented data sources** spread across multiple platforms
- **Inconsistent tournament reporting** formats
- **Limited meta-game analysis** tools
- **Poor user experience** on existing platforms

## The Solution

I built EDHTop16 as a modern, user-friendly platform that addresses these pain points through:

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Tournament Database**: Tracks tournaments from major events to local game store competitions
- **Advanced Deck Analysis**: Detailed breakdowns of winning decks and meta trends
- **Interactive Statistics**: Real-time data visualization and filtering
- **Community-Driven Content**: User submissions and collaborative data collection
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The platform was built using a modern full-stack architecture:

**Frontend**

- **React** with functional components and hooks
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent, utility-first styling
- **Responsive design** ensuring mobile-first user experience
- **Client-side routing** for smooth navigation

**Backend Services**

- **Node.js/Express** API for core application logic
- **FastAPI/Python** for data processing and machine learning features
- **RESTful API design** with comprehensive documentation
- **JWT authentication** for user management

**Database & Infrastructure**

- **MongoDB** for flexible document storage
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployments
- **Redis caching** for improved performance
- **AWS deployment** with auto-scaling capabilities

## Development Highlights

### Performance Optimization

One of the biggest challenges was handling large datasets efficiently:

```javascript
// Implemented pagination and lazy loading for tournament lists
const usePaginatedTournaments = (filters) => {
  const [tournaments, setTournaments] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const loadMore = useCallback(async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await api.getTournaments({
        ...filters,
        offset: tournaments.length,
        limit: 20,
      });
      setTournaments((prev) => [...prev, ...response.data]);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [filters, tournaments.length]);

  return { tournaments, loadMore, loading };
};
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

Built a robust ETL pipeline to process tournament data:

```python
# FastAPI endpoint for processing tournament submissions
@app.post("/api/tournaments/process")
async def process_tournament_data(tournament_data: TournamentSchema):
    """
    Process and validate tournament submissions
    """
    try:
        # Validate deck lists against Scryfall API
        validated_decks = await validate_deck_lists(tournament_data.decks)

        # Extract meta-game statistics
        meta_stats = analyze_tournament_meta(validated_decks)

        # Store processed data
        result = await db.tournaments.insert_one({
            **tournament_data.dict(),
            "processed_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            "meta_analysis": meta_stats
        })

        return {"status": "success", "tournament_id": str(result.inserted_id)}

    except ValidationError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail=str(e))
```

### Real-Time Features

Implemented WebSocket connections for live tournament updates:

```javascript
// Real-time tournament updates
const useRealTimeTournaments = () => {
  const [tournaments, setTournaments] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/tournaments`);

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
      setTournaments((prev) =>
        prev.map((t) =>
          t.id === update.tournament_id ? { ...t, ...update.data } : t,
        ),
      );
    };

    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);

  return tournaments;
};
```

## Impact & Results

### Community Growth

- **100,000+ monthly active users**
- **15,000+ tournaments tracked**
- **50,000+ deck lists in database**
- **Active community** of contributors and moderators

### Performance Metrics

- **< 2 second** average page load time
- **99.9% uptime** over 18 months
- **Mobile traffic** accounts for 65% of users
- **International reach** across 40+ countries

### Technical Achievements

- **Scalable architecture** handling 1M+ API requests monthly
- **Automated testing** with 95% code coverage
- **CI/CD pipeline** enabling daily deployments
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with alerting systems

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Challenges

**Database Design**: Initially struggled with MongoDB schema design for complex tournament structures. Learned to embrace document flexibility while maintaining data consistency.

**API Rate Limiting**: Had to implement sophisticated rate limiting when integrating with external MTG APIs to avoid service disruptions.

**Caching Strategy**: Developed a multi-layered caching approach using Redis and browser caching to handle traffic spikes during major tournaments.

### Product Development

**User Feedback Integration**: Established regular feedback cycles with the community, leading to features like custom meta-game filters and advanced search capabilities.

**Data Quality**: Implemented crowd-sourced validation systems to maintain high data quality while scaling submissions.

## Future Enhancements

The platform continues to evolve with planned features including:

- **Machine Learning** meta-game predictions
- **Mobile app** for iOS and Android
- **Tournament organization tools** for event coordinators
- **Premium analytics** for competitive players
- **API marketplace** for third-party integrations

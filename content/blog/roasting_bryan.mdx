# Roasting my friend's portfolio website

Bryan is a great guy, and I think every developer deserves to have a friend that roasts their projects. So in this post, I'll be kindly remarking on his portfolio site (<Outlink className="underline" href="https://bryanchan.org/">https://bryanchan.org/</Outlink>). Note that this is all in good fun, and he gave me consent to write this post :D

`test`

```python
# comment
hello = "asdf"
```

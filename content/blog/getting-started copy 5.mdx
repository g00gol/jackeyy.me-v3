# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Building a modern blog has never been easier with the combination of Next.js and MDX. This powerful duo allows you to write content in Markdown while having the full power of React components at your disposal.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

```jsx
import { Alert } from "@/components/ui/alert";

<Alert>This is a custom React component inside MDX!</Alert>;
```

## Key Benefits

- **Developer Experience**: Write content in Markdown with React components
- **Performance**: Static generation with Next.js
- **Flexibility**: Custom components for rich content
- **SEO Friendly**: Great metadata and OpenGraph support

## Code Syntax Highlighting

Here's how you can add syntax highlighting to your code blocks:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const getBlogPosts = (): BlogPost[] => {
  // Implementation here
  return posts;
};
```

## Lists and Tables

You can use standard Markdown syntax:

### Features List
